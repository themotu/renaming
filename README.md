# Github is being a sheep and thinks `master` branch is about race

Let's ignore them and not break repos by using master stil, or better yet show support for not being sheep by going to Gitlab


Robot is next? Can you please change all the repositories that reference robots and robotics?

Robot is drawn from an old Church Slavonic word, robota, for “servitude,” “forced labor” or “drudgery.” The word, which also has cognates in German, Russian, Polish and Czech, was a product of the central European system of serfdom by which a tenant’s rent was paid for in forced labor or service.
